name: evil bean soup
contributor: Ernie
source: My mtjer
tools:
  - rice cooker, max capacity 12 cups
  - frying pan
ingredients:
  - pinto beans, large bag
  - bean seasonings; I like salt, cumin, onion powder, garlic powder
  - queso fresco
  - cilantro
  - parsley
  - ghost pepper (1)
  - full packet of turkey ham, or sausages, or any available meat
  - onion (1), diced
steps:
  - rinse beans. soak beans for a couple hours in room temperature water; this'll make the beans cook better later on, though it's technically optional. you should have enough beans that they'll fill up around half the container when done soaking.
  - replace the water with fresh, not stinky water. fill the water to the 12 line, because a lot of it will be Lost while cooking
  - cook beans, and start a timer (i say 1h30m). add your bean seasonings. i also insert the onion at this point, because i typically dislike raw onion outside of a taco. incidentally, this is also how you should cook beans, and all i've done for broth so far is just using bean water
  - dice the ghost pepper in one container, the meat in another container, and the remaining herbs/cheese in another
  - about 15 minutes before the beans are done cooking, fry the meat, so its texture/flavor isn't lost into the rest of the soup.
  - when the beans are done cooking and are no longer boiling, chuck the pepper and meat into the pot.
  - serve with the cotija cheese / parsley / cilantro mixture, left for last because they're Delicate™️
