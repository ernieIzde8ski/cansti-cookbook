name: couscous
contributor: Noé
ingredients:
  - NO MEASUREMENTS.  TRUST GOD
  - vegetables of choice(though my essentials are carrots. carrots only)
  - tomato puree
  - an entire chicken
  - spices(i use tandori spices they work surprisingly well)
  - semoule
steps:
  - ok so what youre gonna do first is youre going to cut the chicken like you usually fucking would you fucking dumbass, remove the legs and wings et cetera. then you put all of the chicken in a big ass pan and you add a little bit of olive oil. You let it cook, enough for it to be a little cripsy in a few places, it is fine if it is not fully cooked for the next step just dont catch salmonella.
  - next youre gonna add some water. inshallah you add not too much because runny couscous is worse than too thick couscous. after you add the water you add the tomato puree. i forgot to mention it in the ingredients but if you have a broth cube feel free to cut it into ltitle bits and add it in there. let it cook for a bit, then add the spices. VBE CAREFUL WITH THE SPICES IF YOU ARE WHITE OR UNFAITHFUL TO GOD otherwise it will be too intense for your weak little tonsils. of course you add salt pepper garlic combo if you dont add them i will find you and feed them directly into your mouth
  - i dont remember if theres anything else. uhhh vegetables. add em i think before the spices...................lmao.........................
  - ok so now ur couscous is cooking but its just the sauce for now so you need smth to eat it with, in comes the semoule idgaf abt the english name its the little yellow grains which are also known as couscous anyways. grab a big bowl, depending on the type of semoule you got, god should guide your hand differently just make sure to add at least a cup of boiling water and lots of butter/butter equivalent then stir and cover the bowl with a towel, it will cook on its own
  - once the broth is done cooking just fucking microwave the semoule and then put that shi in a plate and EAT IT. Voi motherfucking là motherfuckers
